# Table List

**Table List** is an Obsidian plugin that helps you manage tasks in a structured, table-based format—perfect for organizing projects across days or weeks.

## What It Does

Instead of a traditional to-do list, Table List gives you a grid where each row represents a project and each column represents a date. You can click into any cell to assign a task to a specific project and date. Tasks can be updated with a status such as:

- **Haven't Started**
- **In Progress**
- **Completed**

This visual layout is great for planning workloads, tracking progress, and staying organized with minimal effort.

## How to Use

1. **Enable the Plugin**  
   In Obsidian, go to **Settings → Community Plugins → Browse**, search for **Table List**, and enable it after installation.

2. **Create a Table**  
   Open the plugin panel or activate it from the command palette to start a new task table.

3. **Add a Project**  
   Each row in the table corresponds to a project. Add a new row for each project you want to track.

4. **Assign Tasks to Dates**  
   Click on a cell (project x date) and enter the task name.

5. **Track Task Progress**  
   Click on the task cell to change its status between:
   - Haven't Started
   - In Progress
   - Completed

6. **Stay Organized**  
   Use the table to quickly view what needs to be done, when, and for which project.
